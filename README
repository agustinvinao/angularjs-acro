To start hacking on this:

	Create a brach: git checkout -b YOUR_NAME

  Install gems: bundle install

  Start the server: bundle exec rackup

You can update game.rb or remove it and start all over again. Remember to
update the scheduler in config.ru if you discard game.rb altogether.

The rack application is in acro_app.rb. Expose new routes here if needed.

The grape based API is in acro_api.rb. The skeleton has already been provided.
IF you don't want to use grape, that's fine.

Write tests using rspec/cucumber. You will need to add the relevant gems and a
Rakefile to run the tests.

Add AngularJS code in public/javascripts/application.js.

Add styling using CSS/Sass to public/stylesheets/sass/application.css. These
should get automatically compiled to public/stylesheets/application.css by
Sass.

If you add any other CSS/JS files to the project, remember to update
views/index.erb

Then connect to localhost:9292 using your browser.

Note:

  - Writing good, solid code in a test-driven manner is the most important bit
		in this assessment
	
  - Commit changes frequently (every half hour so is good) so we can get an
		idea of how you work
 
	- Finishing the game is not important at all. 
	If however you want to send us a completed version in your
		own time, that will be great :)
